# Upper-Gastrointestinal-Tract-LSTM

This project focuses on predicting the prognosis of cancer patients using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly effective for time-series and sequential data. By leveraging patient health records, including demographic information and clinical data, the model aims to provide accurate predictions on patient outcomes. The project also includes real-time analysis of crude rates and survival rate which can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and improving personalized treatment plans.
